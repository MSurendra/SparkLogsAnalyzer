{"name":"Sparklogsanalyzer","tagline":"","body":"# Logs Analyzer in Spark\r\n\r\nThis project demonstrates how easy it is to do logs analysis with Apache Spark.\r\n\r\nLogs analysis is an ideal use case for Spark.  It's a very large, common data source and contains a rich set of information.  Spark allows you to store your logs\r\nin files to disk cheaply, while still providing a\r\nquick and simple way to process them.  We hope this project will show you to use\r\nApache Spark on your organization's production logs and fully harness the power\r\nof that data.  Logs data can be used for monitoring your servers, improving business and customer intelligence, building recommendation systems, preventing fraud, and much more.\r\n\r\nThis project will also appeal to those who want to learn Spark and\r\nlearn better by example.  Those readers can browse the chapters, see\r\nwhat features of the logs analyzer is similar to their use case, and\r\nrefashion the code samples for their needs.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this is meant to be a practical guide for using Spark in your\r\nsystems, so we'll even touch other technologies that are compatible with Spark - such as where to store your files.\r\n\r\n## How to use this project\r\n\r\nThis project is broken up into chapters with bite-sized examples for\r\ndemonstrating new Spark functionality for logs processing.  This makes\r\nthe examples easy to run and learn as they cover just one new topic at a time.\r\nAt the end, we assemble some of these examples to form a sample logs\r\nanalyzer application.\r\n\r\n###[Chapter 1: Introduction to Apache Spark](chapter1/README.md)\r\n\r\nThe Apache Spark library is introduced, including RDD's, transformation,\r\nand actions.  We'll also introduce Spark SQL and Spark Streaming.  By the\r\nend of this chapter, a reader will know how to do queries with Apache Spark.\r\n\r\n###[Chapter 2: Importing and Exporting Data](chapter2/README.md)\r\n\r\nThis chapter includes examples to illustrate how to get your data in\r\nand out of Spark.  It is also recommended that you bring up a local Spark cluster, as you should know how to run Spark on a dataset that is too\r\nbig to fit on one machine.\r\n\r\n### [Final Chapter: Logs Analyzer Application](app/README.md)\r\n\r\nThis section puts together some of the code in the other chapters to form\r\na sample log analysis application.\r\n\r\n## More to come...\r\n\r\nWhile that's all for now, there's definitely more to come - expect more features to the log reference application over time.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
