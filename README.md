# SparkLogsAnalyzer

This project contains a reference application for Apache
Spark on logs analysis.  In particular, our example will process Apache
access log files, since that's a common and simple data format.  Logs
analysis is a great use case for Spark, as it's a very large data source
that can be expensive to persist to a database for processing.
At the same time, there is a lot of useful information contained in logs
that a lot of organizations aren't making use of.
We hope to show easy it is to use Spark for logs analysis, and that you'll
use these examples on your logs data to unleash a ton of interesting new
insights.

This project will also appeal to those who learn better by example.
